## Features

- Data ingestion from various sources
- Data processing and transformation
- Integration with Kafka for event-driven architecture
- PostgreSQL database for storing ingested data
- RESTful API for data ingestion and retrieval
- Error handling and logging for robustness
- Docker and Kubernetes support for deployment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run Nimbus Flow, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- PostgreSQL database
- Kafka (optional, based on project requirements)
- Docker (optional, for containerization)
- Kubernetes (optional, for deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the Nimbus Flow repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nimbus-flow.git
cd nimbus-flow
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration

1. Configure the database connection:
   - Open the `config/database.js` file.
   - Update the database credentials and connection details according to your PostgreSQL setup.

2. Configure any other project-specific settings:
   - Open the `config/config.json` file.
   - Modify the configuration parameters as per your requirements.

### Running the Application

1. Start the application:

```bash
npm start
```

The Nimbus Flow microservice will start running on the specified port (default: 3000).

## Usage

Once the Nimbus Flow microservice is up and running, you can use the following endpoints for data ingestion and retrieval:

- **POST /data**: Ingest data into Nimbus Flow. The data should be sent as a JSON payload in the request body.
- **GET /data**: Retrieve ingested data from Nimbus Flow. Optionally, you can specify query parameters to filter the data.

Refer to the [API Documentation](#api-documentation) section for detailed information on using these endpoints.

## API Documentation

The API documentation for Nimbus Flow can be found [here](docs/api.md). It provides detailed information about the available endpoints, request/response formats, and example usage.

## Architecture

Nimbus Flow follows a microservice architecture with the following components:

- **Controllers**: Handle incoming requests, perform data validation, and invoke the service layer.
- **Services**: Implement the core business logic for data ingestion and processing.
- **Models**: Define the data schema and interact with the PostgreSQL database.
- **Routes**: Define the API routes and map them to the appropriate controllers.
- **Kafka Integration**: Optionally integrates with Kafka to publish events or messages related to the data ingestion process.
- **Docker and Kubernetes**: Supports containerization and deployment using Docker and Kubernetes for scalability and easy deployment.

For a detailed understanding of the architecture, refer to the [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) documentation.
